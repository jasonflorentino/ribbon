# Ribbon
***Ribbon is the app that makes gift-giving (and gift-receiving) a breeze!***

It's also my capstone project for BrainStation's full-stack bootcamp. We were tasked to ideate, plan, and execute a full-stack application within two weeks. Ribbon was made using create-react-app, react-router, and SASS for the front end, a Node/Express backend API with JWT for auth, and Knex to query a MySQL database. At least for now. We'll see how things change as I continue to build on it.
